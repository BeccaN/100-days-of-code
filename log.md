# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started my Tasker app, a task manager app. Incorporated flex display and got the very beginnings of my React components started. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
Working with CSS still looks like the magical unicorn in the forest to me. My plans are to keep focusing on basic functionality on the app for right now, and then start on styling.

### Day 2: April 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added in the new task form portion with dynamic add input button. Refactored components to be better organized. 

**Thoughts:** I spent a lot of time moving things around in my components today and just becoming more comfortable with React. React still feels very strange to me, but I can see that the more I use it the more familiar it becomes. Spent some time practicing converting my components between functional-class components, I plan on converting several of my class components over to functional components.

### Day 3: April 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on my new task form.

**Thoughts:** Kept working on getting the new task form to work. Submit button still doesn't work, didn't have a ton of time to devote to code today, but the time I did spend I became more familiar with storing state and passing props down from parent to child components.

### Day 4: April 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Converted my class components to functional components, and started learning more about Redux!

**Thoughts:** Coverted all my class components to functional components. This really helped me see and better understand the differences in how to use class vs functional components. I also started learning about Redux this week! I need to stick with this and maybe watch some additional tutorials, still dont have this properly implemented in my Tasker app.

### Day 5: April 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Incorporated Redux into my app and got the new task button working!

**Thoughts:** Got my Redux store and a basic add task functionality working. Definitely need to practice Redux more! I had a big hiccup with my  `export default` line, because I included a `mapDispatchToProps` without a `mapStateToProps`. I then learned that I needed to include `null` for the first arugment slot.
