# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started my Tasker app, a task manager app. Incorporated flex display and got the very beginnings of my React components started. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
Working with CSS still looks like the magical unicorn in the forest to me. My plans are to keep focusing on basic functionality on the app for right now, and then start on styling.

### Day 2: April 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added in the new task form portion with dynamic add input button. Refactored components to be better organized. 

**Thoughts:** I spent a lot of time moving things around in my components today and just becoming more comfortable with React. React still feels very strange to me, but I can see that the more I use it the more familiar it becomes. Spent some time practicing converting my components between functional-class components, I plan on converting several of my class components over to functional components.
